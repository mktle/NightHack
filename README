Built off NetHack 3.6.7 with the goal of reducing frustration while keeping gameplay largely untouched. It can be compiled by following the instructions at https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Compiling.

Implemented changes from vanilla:
    - paranoia for hitting floating eyes without protection
    - paranoia for stepping into pools or lava without protection
    - #genocided command generates a list of genocided species
